									<h1>2D Game</h1>
									<p>Entertaining Project</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/game.jpg" alt="Game" /></div>
								<p>Provided with partially completed software, my task was to focus on the GameEngine class, where I would complete methods crucial for 
									implementing the game's rules and interactions. The existing code already handled graphics rendering and user input, thus my focus 
									was on writing Java methods to build key components of the 
									game engine, specifying what should be displayed on screen and how the system should respond to user interactions via keyboard inputs.
                                    </p>
								<p>The project provided to me was a Netbeans project containing seven Java source code files along with graphical image files nested 
									within the project folder. Prior to embarking on the tasks, I meticulously reviewed and analyzed each class, ensuring a comprehensive 
									understanding of the software's structure and functionality. I adhered closely to the provided documentation, which outlined 
									the objectives of each task and provided guidance on how to complete the associated methods. Throughout the development process, 
									I employed the knowledge and skills 
									acquired during the module, leveraging Java programming techniques to fulfill the requirements outlined in the task descriptions. </p>
								<p>As I progressed through the tasks, the program evolved to become more functional, with each completed task yielding visible outputs 
									on the screen. This iterative approach allowed me to test and assess the effectiveness of my code against the task descriptions 
									and method documentation. While my primary focus remained on the GameEngine class, I exercised caution to refrain from making 
									modifications to other classes unless explicitly directed by the module coordinator. Overall, this project provided a valuable 
									opportunity to apply 
									theoretical concepts to real-world software development, honing my Java programming skills and problem-solving abilities in the process.</p>
