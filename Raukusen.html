									<h1>Raukusen's</h1>
									<p>Warehouse Management System (VMS) Project</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rakusen.png" alt="Raukusens logo" /></div>
								<p>The project involves transitioning to a paperless inventory management system. The goal is 
									to efficiently record stock by best before date (BBD) and implement stock rotation. This 
									includes booking finished and bought-in products using SKU codes and BBD date codes, as 
									well as managing raw materials and packaging within the same system. The system should 
									identify product batches based on date codes when receiving order details and generate 
									reports for product details, quantities, and locations. </p>
								<p>In exploring existing solutions, it's crucial to review paperless inventory management systems 
									within the food industry. Focus on how these systems handle stock recording, especially 
									emphasizing best before dates and stock rotation. Investigate systems that efficiently manage 
									SKU codes and BBD dates, facilitating the booking of products. Additionally, look for literature 
									on systems that effectively handle raw materials and packaging within a unified application. </p>
								<p>User management is key, and it's essential to find literature on systems that tailor access 
									permissions based on employee roles. Dynamic creation of products, including editing and 
									deletion, should be explored in terms of attributes such as product name, picture, and shelf 
									life. Investigate systems incorporating data analytics for purchase orders, products, and 
									inventory levels, paying attention to dynamic charts and customizable reports. </p>
								<p>Explore alert systems that address inventory expiration and low stock counts relative to 
									pending orders, understanding how timely notifications enhance decision-making. Lastly, 
									delve into literature discussing responsive design for applications, ensuring they function 
									seamlessly across both desktop and tablet devices. This comprehensive review will provide 
									insights into existing solutions and best practices for the successful implementation of the 
									proposed warehouse system for Rakusens.
