									<h1>Home Heaven</h1>
									<p>Business Promoting Project</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/HomeHeaven.png" alt="HomeHeaven" /></div>
								<p>I developed a dynamic website for "Home Heaven," a new furniture shop dedicated to providing the best furniture and 
                                    accessories for homes and offices. This website was built using a comprehensive stack of web technologies, including HTML5, 
                                    CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The aim was to create a user-friendly, visually appealing platform that offers both functionality 
                                    and aesthetic appeal. The site features a main page introducing the store and its offerings, accompanied 
                                    by a navigation menu that links to various themed pages, including product categories, special offers, and customer testimonials.
                                    </p>
								<p>A critical feature of the website is its dynamic content, driven by a MySQL database. This allows the site to offer up-to-date 
                                    information on products and availability. Both administrators and general users have tailored experiences on the platform. 
                                    Administrators can log in to manage the site by adding, modifying, and deleting user accounts, as well as updating product details, 
                                    including names, prices, and descriptions. General users, on the other hand, can register and log in to view products, search for specific items, 
                                    and add or remove items from their shopping baskets. This dynamic interaction 
                                    is facilitated through PHP scripts that handle data retrieval and updates, ensuring a seamless and responsive shopping experience. </p>
								<p>Overall, the HomeHeaven Furniture website project demonstrates not only technical proficiency in web development but also a 
                                    keen eye for design and user experience. By integrating HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, I 
                                    was able to create a robust, interactive, and visually appealing platform that meets the needs of both the business and its 
                                    customers.</p>
